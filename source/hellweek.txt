https://circuitdigest.com/microcontroller-projects/optical-character-recognition-ocr-using-tesseract-on-raspberry-pi
* set up environment
* image processing and normalization pipeline
[open] -> [size] -> [gray] -> [blur] -> [edges] -> [contours] -> [crop] -> [OCR]
* can use the human-interaction which dictates whaich size of rectangle to grab fopr a session

Tuesday:
https://scikit-image.org/docs/stable/api/skimage.exposure.html -> smarter grays
* rework markPlaque in ShapeDetection to take and return things properly
* finish man-interaction pipeline
* use feature-free ur-image to provide 'human input' ( proper camera location, with obvious plaque in center for calibration)
* HOG and other image dectector

installed ROS melodic for ubuntu 18.04
following tutorials from ROS.org, starting with:
http://wiki.ros.org/catkin/Tutorials/create_a_workspace
/home/$USER/catkin_ws

now to create a package
http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/CreatingPackage

(in catkin_ws/src): catkin_create_pkg <package_name> [dep1][dep2][...]

step back up to catkin_ws, run: catkin_make
then: . ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
to add the new workspace to ROS envi

edit the package.xml file to be descriptive

use catkin_make to build

found rospy tutorial for subscribing to image:
wiki.ros.org/rospy_tutorials/Tutorials/WritingImagePublisherSubscriber

added 'usb_cam' to package by doing this:
`cd ~/catkin_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/bosch-ros-pkg/usb_cam.git
cd ..
catkin_make`

then source the setup.bash file!

edited usb_cam usb_cam-test.launch
(roscd usb_cam, etc)
changed source to /dev/video1, and vis from image_view to rqt_image_view (opencv/gtk issue?)

# 10-21 - had issue converting image_raw to cv2, https://github.com/erlerobot/gym-gazebo/issues/93
- trying to put it all in a package

# turns out cv_boost doesnt work with python3.
- attempted to compile with python 3 instead of 2, hitting error:

- followed guide at https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49221565/unable-to-use-cv-bridge-with-ros-kinetic-and-python3
- changed CMAKE argument to point at python3.6 library, BUT still get error.

# going to try to convert image_raw to image/Compressed like this https://answers.ros.org/question/35183/compressed-image-to-image/
- rosrun image_transport republish raw in:=/image_raw compressed out:=/image
- it works! Now back to reading the plaques.

# for the initial choice of plaque, using tkinter to provide a GUI 
- tkinter image https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23901168/how-do-i-insert-a-jpeg-image-into-a-python-tkinter-window
- tkinter radio button https://www.python-course.eu/tkinter_radiobuttons.php
- idea is to find contours in a calibration image, use the array ( or dicitonary) of contours to provide the USER
    with a few choices, and the one that is picked is set as the ur-plaque.
    - if none of the contours are of the plaque, the threshold tipping point is changed and try again. (currently set at ~170)

    - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46284901/how-do-i-resize-buttons-in-pixels-tkinter to size things correctly


# 10-23-18 going through, got it mostly working but some plaques are not showing up
- adding a debug mode to show thresheld image
- some of the hallway is too dark. added threshold customixzation to CI thresh(), not perfect though.
    - maybe better camera?
    - upon taking to advr, going to run sobel or laplacian before thresholding and getting contours.
    https://docs.opencv.org/3.0-beta/doc/py_tutorials/py_imgproc/py_gradients/py_gradients.html


# 10-25-18 trying to grab lost plaques
- monkeying with setting on contour kernel, opening and closing, etc
- double-processing each image (or tripel) with differnt threshold values
    - actually grabs a few more, still missing 254

- back to text reading
    - have pytesseract installed, but not tesseract ocr
        - sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr

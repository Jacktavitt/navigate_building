installed ROS melodic for ubuntu 18.04
following tutorials from ROS.org, starting with:
http://wiki.ros.org/catkin/Tutorials/create_a_workspace
/home/$USER/catkin_ws

now to create a package
http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/CreatingPackage

(in catkin_ws/src): catkin_create_pkg <package_name> [dep1][dep2][...]

step back up to catkin_ws, run: catkin_make
then: . ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
to add the new workspace to ROS envi

edit the package.xml file to be descriptive

use catkin_make to build

found rospy tutorial for subscribing to image:
wiki.ros.org/rospy_tutorials/Tutorials/WritingImagePublisherSubscriber

added 'usb_cam' to package by doing this:
`cd ~/catkin_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/bosch-ros-pkg/usb_cam.git
cd ..
catkin_make`

then source the setup.bash file!

edited usb_cam usb_cam-test.launch
(roscd usb_cam, etc)
changed source to /dev/video1, and vis from image_view to rqt_image_view (opencv/gtk issue?)

# 10-21 - had issue converting image_raw to cv2, https://github.com/erlerobot/gym-gazebo/issues/93

# turns out cv_boost doesnt work with python3.
- attempted to compile with python 3 instead of 2, hitting error:

tutorial from http://wiki.ros.org/camera_calibration/Tutorials/MonocularCalibration

printed out an image, 4 X 5 black blocks, each block 23 mm

ran my script

ran
rosrun rqt_graph rqt_graph
to get the graph output
then ran 
rostopic echo /usb_cam/image_raw
which spat out lots of numbers, i think poixel vlaues
ran
rostopic type /usb_cam/image_raw
and it told me 'sensor_msgs/Image'

ran:
rosrun camera_calibration cameracalibrator.py --size 8x--square .023 image=:/usb_cam/image_raw camera=:/usb_cam



didn't work. added
 --no-service-check 
 but it didnt work.


 ran
 rosmake camera_calibration
 and restarted the computer.
 ran
 rosrun camera_calibration cameracalibrator.py --size 8x6 --square 0.023 image:=/usb_cam/image_raw camera:=/usb_cam
 and it worked! Moved the grid around and it caught most of it.
 Hit 'calibrate' button and am waiting for it to finish.

got his from output:
[ INFO] [1523839130.452026260]: Using transport "raw"
[ INFO] [1523840379.784780636]: writing calibration data to /home/johnny/.ros/camera_info/head_camera.yaml

adding calibration file to this repo. WILL NEED to redo if the fisheye is bumped or removed.

ran, thanks to https://github.com/tum-vision/lsd_slam/issues/293
 rosrun lsd_slam_core live_slam /image:=/usb_cam/image_raw /camera_info:=/usb_cam _calib:=/home/johnny/Documents/thesis/navigate_building/source/SLAM/head_camera.txt
 which started the lsd_viewer!

sometimes USB camera is not default (/dev/video0)

so it must be added to arguments for usb_cam

rosrun usb_cam usb_cam_node ~video_device /dev/video1

some successful runs => got an error-throw:
terminate called after throwing an instance of 'Sophus::ScaleNotPositive'
  what():  Sophus exception: Scale factor is not positive
Aborted (core dumped)

happened twice, not sure what it means.

might be able to make a bag, and run it:

set up camera, but not lsd_slam

rosbag record -a

then when done:

shut everything down except for roscore

rosparam set use_sim_time true
rosbag play <bagname> --clock # use time in bagfile

run the lsd_slam 

save it?

did a bag of hallway:

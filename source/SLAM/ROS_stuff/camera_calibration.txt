tutorial from http://wiki.ros.org/camera_calibration/Tutorials/MonocularCalibration

printed out an image, 4 X 5 black blocks, each block 23 mm

ran my script

ran
rosrun rqt_graph rqt_graph
to get the graph output
then ran 
rostopic echo /usb_cam/image_raw
which spat out lots of numbers, i think poixel vlaues
ran
rostopic type /usb_cam/image_raw
and it told me 'sensor_msgs/Image'

ran:
rosrun camera_calibration cameracalibrator.py --size 8x--square .023 image=:/usb_cam/image_raw camera=:/usb_cam



didn't work. added
 --no-service-check 
 but it didnt work.


 ran
 rosmake camera_calibration
 and restarted the computer.
 ran
 rosrun camera_calibration cameracalibrator.py --size 8x6 --square 0.023 image:=/usb_cam/image_raw camera:=/usb_cam
 and it worked! Moved the grid around and it caught most of it.
 Hit 'calibrate' button and am waiting for it to finish.

got his from output:
[ INFO] [1523839130.452026260]: Using transport "raw"
[ INFO] [1523840379.784780636]: writing calibration data to /home/johnny/.ros/camera_info/head_camera.yaml
